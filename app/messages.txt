"You define your own life. Don't let other people write your script."
"You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream."
"You can be everything. You can be the infinite amount of things that people are."
"Believe you can and you're halfway there."
"Weaknesses are just strengths in the wrong environment."
"Silence is the last thing the world will ever hear from me."
